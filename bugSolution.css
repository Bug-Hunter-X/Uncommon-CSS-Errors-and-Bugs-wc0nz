The solution involves carefully reviewing the CSS code for the following:

1. **Verify Property and Value Validity:** Check the CSS specification for valid properties and their accepted values. Use browser developer tools to inspect the rendered elements and identify which CSS properties are causing unexpected behavior.
2. **Correct Selector Usage:** Ensure proper use of selectors, especially `:nth-child`, parent-child selectors, and more complex selectors. Use browser developer tools to inspect which elements are being selected.
3. **Address Specificity Issues:** Understand CSS specificity rules. When selectors conflict, it may be necessary to override one selector with a more specific one. Use the !important rule sparingly to resolve specificity conflicts. 
4. **Test Across Browsers:** Test your code in multiple browsers and screen sizes to detect rendering inconsistencies caused by browser-specific interpretations of CSS.
