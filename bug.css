The CSS code uses an invalid or unsupported property or value. For instance, using a non-existent vendor prefix or an incorrect value for a property can cause unexpected behavior or rendering issues.  Another common issue is misusing selectors like incorrect use of the `:nth-child` selector or forgetting to use the correct parent-child selector.
